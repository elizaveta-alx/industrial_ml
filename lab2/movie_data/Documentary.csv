The documentary features numerous other protagonists such as feminist porn director Giuliana Gamba, author Lidia Ravera and a short animation by Charlie Hebdo's veteran SinÃ©. Through their utopia and shocking dreams, they made the world a freer place and paved the way for forward-thinking debates today, such as neo-feminism, or the LGBT rights movement.::carmine amoroso",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4YTU0NzktMGY0Mi00YjkyLTkxNWUtZjZiMDFkNzk5NDhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI5OTU1MjM@.jpg
